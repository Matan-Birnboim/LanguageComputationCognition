        "We'll walk you through the example of logistic regression that we covered during class, where we took a dataset of binomial expressions and inferred the relative strengths of the short-before-long and frequent-before-infrequent ordering preferences.  We first load the dataset, which consists of a number of binomial expressions each of which was observed once in a sample of the Brown corpus, in the order given in the dataset.  In this dataset, `Syl` and `Freq` respectively denote whether the observed ordering matches the preference (an entry of `1`), violates the preference (an entry of `-1`), or is irrelevant for the preference (an entry of `0`, indicating that either ordering would satisfy the preference).  `Percept` indicates matching or violation of the perceptual markedness preference, and `Response` is a dummy variable whose value is always `1`, which we will use in fitting the logistic regression model."

In `statsmodels`, as in most software packages implementing logistic regression, it is a convention that the numeric coding of the outcome or response is `1` for \"success\" and `0` otherwise.  Also as in most software packages for logistic regression, we use matrix formats to represent the response & predictors: so if there are $M$ predictors and $N$ observations, then the predictor set is represented as an $M \\times N$ matrix and the response variable is represented as a $1 \\times N$ matrix (effectively a length-$N$ vector).

        "As previously discussed, the coefficient values indicate that the original variables, recipient and theme pronominiality, hold significant importance in the model. The length variables, on the other hand, do not contribute as substantially. However, we learned in class about Panini's Law and its relationship to Ordering Preferences, where shorter words in terms of syllables tend to take precedence. Although this is not directly applicable to our specific case, there is a connection between word length and number of syllables (albeit imperfect). Intuitively, this connection makes sense, and exploring a model that incorporates this relationship would be intriguing.\n",

        "Considering the high accuracy achieved without including the length variables, there is a possibility of overfitting. Moreover, incorporating length variables aligns with linguistic sensibility. Additionally, in our case, larger DO phrases are often reported as awkward, suggesting that length may influence the outcome. To integrate these variables into the model, we propose incorporating first-degree interactions between the variables. It is important to note that it would not make sense linguistically to add interactions between variables that pertain to different objects. Therefore, we will introduce the variables 'RecPro & LengthofRecipient' as well as 'ThemePro & LengthofTheme'. Furthermore, we will utilize log-transformed length rather than the raw length, as it yielded a better fit in our case."

        "The algorithm's performance is limited to the information it has been trained on and the patterns it has learned from the data. It may struggle to grasp the intricacies of certain analogies that require additional contextual understanding beyond the surface-level associations present in the word embeddings.\n",

Continued research and advancements in natural language processing aim to improve the algorithms' ability to handle more complex analogies and align them more closely with human reasoning."
