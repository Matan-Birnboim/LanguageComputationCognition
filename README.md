# Project 4 GloVe BERT debiasing  | Language Computation Cognition

Final project for the Language & Computation & Cognition course, in the field of biases and debiasing in language model embeddings and fMRI Brainâ€™s voxels, compares BERT & GloVe word embeddings, analyzing Biases inherent to word vectors and Debiasing methods based on big data from research.

# Project 4 - GloVe BERT debiasing

- Chose to share this project as an example, to reflect my thought process and coding abilities with regards to:

	- NLP (Natural Language Processing) Project 
	- Implementation of learning models on some importent word embeddings
	- Analysis and extracting insights from data
	- A full research report in the fields of language and cognition
	  
## How to review

- I recommend starting from reading the project assignment overview guidlines, to understand the project (Project Guidelines.pdf, part 2)
- If at some point the background is not clear, I recommend going through the HW3 folder, on which this project is based.
- Next, look into the colab notebook "Language Computation Cognition Project.ipynb", You can also see the code itself at "Language&Computation&Cognition_Project.py".
- Last, read the article we wrote "Project_Language&Computation&Cognition.pdf".

## No code needed review (if you dont want to read any code files)

- Project Guidelines.pdf, part 2.
